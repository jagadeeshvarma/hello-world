# 3 Legal Pathways to Move to Europe in 2026 Study Work and Business Explained Clearly

## Executive summary

This document is a research based slide briefing for a free online webinar of 90 minutes aimed at students, professionals, and families who want a clear and realistic route to move to Europe through study, skilled work, or business. The core design choice is to keep the webinar high level while still giving legally accurate facts that people can use right away for planning.

The webinar uses three anchor countries for concrete examples and numbers: entity["country","Sweden","country in eu"], entity["country","Germany","country in eu"], and entity["country","Netherlands","country in eu"]. The reason is simple: each represents a different mix of education costs, labour market structure, and permit frameworks, and each has very clear official documentation for study, work, and business routes. citeturn1view0turn10search6turn4search0turn12search1turn17search7turn17search2

The most “load bearing” facts you will use repeatedly during the webinar are these:

Students in Sweden must typically show SEK 10,656 per month for 2026 for a higher education study permit, and accompanying family increases the monthly amount. citeturn1view0

Germany’s standard proof of funds for a study visa is widely communicated as 992 euros per month, which equals 11,904 euros in 2026, and non EU students may work up to 140 full days or 280 half days per year, with an alternative model also described as up to 20 hours per week during term. citeturn2search14turn2search30turn0search9

The Netherlands sets a required study amount for 2026 of 1,130.77 euros per month for university or higher professional education, and student work is limited to 16 hours per week or full time in June, July, and August, with a work permit required. citeturn17search7turn12search2

Post study job search style permits are time limited and usually not extendable: Sweden offers up to 1 year after completing higher education studies, Germany offers up to 18 months after graduating in Germany, and the Netherlands orientation year is 1 year. citeturn3view0turn12search0turn9view0

For the work route, salary thresholds are specific and updated regularly. For example, Germany’s EU Blue Card minimum salary is shown as 50,700 euros for 2026 and 45,934.20 euros for shortage occupations and young professionals, while the Netherlands sets a 2026 monthly gross minimum of 5,942 euros for Highly Skilled Migrants aged 30 and over and 4,357 euros for under 30. citeturn4search0turn17search7

Sweden’s current work permit “good living” minimum is 29,680 SEK per month, based on 80 percent of the median salary at the time of application. The Swedish Government has announced an agreement to move to 90 percent, which would be 33,390 SEK on current figures, with further work on exemptions. This is an important “policy moving” area to handle carefully in wording. citeturn14search2turn14search1

The briefing below provides 30 slides with speaker notes, slide bullets, legal facts, checklists, and citations, plus a country comparison table, three case studies, and two mermaid diagrams you can copy into slides.

## Assumptions and legal boundaries

Assumptions used in this webinar structure:

• The primary audience is non EU citizens. EU and EEA citizens often have very different rights of residence and do not follow the same permit steps. This difference is acknowledged early to avoid confusion. citeturn16search0turn16search2

• The webinar focuses on three anchor countries for numbers. The same pathway logic can apply across the entity["organization","European Union","political economic union"], but exact thresholds and rules differ by country. citeturn16search0turn17search0

• Where rules are in active political change, the webinar states what is current today and separately states what is announced or proposed, with clear dates and citations. An example is Sweden’s announced move toward a higher salary floor for work permits. citeturn14search2turn14search1

Areas to flag as needing professional support, without giving legal advice:

• Business immigration almost always involves tax, company law, and in some cases regulated profession rules. National authorities can assess “economic benefit”, credibility of funds, and genuine business activity, which is fact specific. citeturn6view0turn12search1turn7view0turn8view0

• Family reunification can include integration or language requirements in some countries and can differ across residence types. Requirements should be verified per country and per permit type. citeturn15search7turn15search22

• Cross border mobility, short stays, and the role of the Schengen area are often misunderstood. Schengen is not the same as the EU, and it is not a work authorisation by itself. citeturn16search9turn16search0

## Country comparison and key numbers

### Europe clusters for shortlisting

The webinar uses a clustering method to reduce overwhelm. Instead of “all EU”, attendees shortlist by practical cluster features such as language, labour market style, tuition model, and permit rules. Key baseline context includes the EU having 27 member states. citeturn16search0

image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"16:9","query":["map of europe regions nordics germany benelux","europe map nordic countries germany netherlands","map of european union member states 2026"],"num_per_query":1}

When you speak about clusters, keep them simple:

• Nordics example Sweden  
• German speaking core example Germany  
• Benelux North Sea corridor example Netherlands  

This style prevents the audience from thinking they must choose from dozens of countries without a method.

### Anchor facts you can cite in the webinar

• EU countries are 27. citeturn16search0  
• EU population is commonly described as about 450 million. Eurostat reports 450.4 million on 1 January 2025 and also projects a peak around 2026 at about 453.3 million. citeturn16search8turn16search1  
• The Schengen area consists of 29 countries, including 25 EU member states and 4 non EU countries. citeturn16search9  
• The EEA includes EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, while Switzerland is not an EEA member. citeturn16search6turn16search2

• Choose 2 to 3 countries only

Speaker notes  
• Explain clustering as a way to reduce overwhelm  
• Give quick examples: Sweden, Germany, Netherlands  
• Mention that job market and housing can matter as much as visas  
• Tell them they will later compare the three anchors in one table

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden, Germany, Netherlands are all EU member states. citeturn16search0  
• Cross border travel ease via Schengen does not replace residence permits for non EU citizens. citeturn16search9

Speaker notes  
• Explain these are official minimums used in permit contexts, not luxury budgets  
• Explain what “proof of funds” means in each country at a high level  
• Warn that housing costs can be the biggest uncertainty, especially in the Netherlands

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden maintenance requirement for higher education study permits in 2026 is 10,656 SEK per month. citeturn1view0

Slide title  
The 3 pathways and who they fit

On slide bullets  
• Study: best when you can invest time and want a structured entry  
• Work: best when you have strong skills and can meet salary floors  
• Business: best when you have capital, experience, and risk tolerance  
• Family members usually join through your main permit

Speaker notes  
• Explain each pathway in one sentence  
• Say families are part of the planning in every pathway  
• Set expectations: business is not a “shortcut” path, it is a complex path

Legal and technical facts  
• National self employment permits can require significant funds and specific evidence, such as Sweden’s proof of funds for self employed people. citeturn6view0

### Slide 8

Slide title  
Decision lens: Time Money Profile

On slide bullets  
• Time: how fast do you need to move  
• Money: can you fund 12 months without stress  
• Profile: degree, skills, experience, language  
• Family: schooling, spouse work, childcare

Speaker notes  
• Explain this lens will be used in each pathway section  
• If they do not have money for the study route, they must not commit blindly  
• If they do not meet salary thresholds for work route, they need upskilling and time

Legal and technical facts  
• Work permits can require a minimum salary set by national authorities, such as Sweden’s “good living” amount. citeturn14search2

Speaker notes  
• Explain study is a structured entry because the sequence is clear  
• Stress that admission is usually the first gate, not the visa  
• Explain that some countries allow post study job search permits, but they are time limited

• Sweden: up to 1 year to look for work or explore starting a business  
• Germany: up to 18 months to look for qualified work after graduation  
• Netherlands: 1 year orientation year, work freely permitted  
• These permits are time limited and usually not extendable

Speaker notes  
• Explain that post study permits are bridges, not permanent solutions  
• Show the key question: can you convert to a work permit in time  
• Stress preparation: internships, projects, language, networking begin during study

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden post study job search permit: maximum 1 year, cannot be extended, and requires proof of funds for 12 months plus health insurance in some cases. citeturn3view0  
• Germany post study job search: up to 18 months for graduates and you may work during the period. citeturn12search0turn12search12  
• Netherlands orientation year: valid 1 year, cannot be extended, work freely permitted without TWV. citeturn9view0

Slide title  
Families and study route what changes

On slide bullets  
• Sweden: family can apply and financial requirement increases  
• Germany and Netherlands: family rules differ by permit type and may add requirements  
• Plan schooling, childcare, and spouse work rights early  
• A realistic plan can be “one moves first”

Speaker notes  
• Explain that “family relocation” is not a separate fourth pathway in this webinar  
• It is a planning layer on top of study, work, or business  
• Use Sweden as a clear numerical example for family funds  
• Remind them to think about healthcare access and insurance

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden study permit family additions to monthly maintenance in 2026: spouse 4,440 SEK per month and each child 2,664 SEK per month. citeturn1view0  
• Sweden caseworker guidance indicates family members can apply later and must show their own financial maintenance requirements in some cases. citeturn18view0  
• In Germany, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees states family members coming for family reunification are allowed to work in Germany. citeturn15search22  

Attendee action items  
• If you have children, map childcare and school age needs for the first year  
• Decide if spouse needs work access from day one  
• Create two budgets: single mover and family of three or four

### Slide 14

Slide title  
Study costs quick reality check

On slide bullets  
• Sweden: tuition varies, often stated as about 90,000 to 150,000 SEK per year for many non EU students  
• Germany: tuition often none at public universities, but semester contributions apply  
• Netherlands: typical non EU tuition ranges 9,000 to 20,000 euros bachelors, 12,000 to 30,000 euros masters  
• Living costs are a separate and serious line item

Speaker notes  
• Explain tuition is only one part, living costs and housing matter more  
• Give simple guidance: do not choose country based only on “cheap tuition”  
• Stress reading programme pages and official portals

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden tuition averages are commonly described as around 90,000 to 150,000 SEK per year for non EU students in government communication materials, with subject variation. citeturn13search9  
• Germany students must pay semester contributions and this is distinct from tuition fees. citeturn13search2  
• Netherlands non EU tuition ranges provided by Study in NL. citeturn13search3  

Attendee action items  
• Get a programme specific tuition quote from official university pages  
• Add your living cost baseline using the official monthly amounts  
• Add one time setup costs: housing deposit, furniture basics, transport cards

### Slide 15

Slide title  
Case study student pathway example timeline and costs

On slide bullets  
• Example: masters in Sweden, then 1 year job search permit  
• Year 1 study and local projects  
• Year 2 job search and conversion to work permit  
• Budget uses official minimum funds plus tuition estimate

Speaker notes  
• Explain this is a planning example, not a promise  
• Show how the legal numbers translate into a real budget  
• Explain the key success factor is employability built during the degree

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden study permit maintenance requirement in 2026: 10,656 SEK per month. citeturn1view0  
• Sweden post study permit to look for work: up to 1 year, cannot be extended. citeturn3view0  
• Sweden work permit “good living” current minimum: 29,680 SEK per month. citeturn14search2  

Attendee action items  
• Write your own version of this timeline for your target country  
• Identify the conversion point and what proof you need  
• Set a goal: one internship or project per term

Planning example numbers for the case study  
Assume a 12 month masters programme with 12 months living funds proof.

• Living funds proof baseline: 10,656 SEK × 12 = 127,872 SEK citeturn1view0  
• Tuition: use your programme specific fee, with a rough planning range often described as about 90,000 to 150,000 SEK per year for many programmes citeturn13search9  
• Total baseline planning range for year 1: about 218,000 to 278,000 SEK plus travel and setup costs  
This is a planning estimate. Actual tuition and housing can vary strongly by city and programme.

### Slide 16

Slide title  
Pathway 2 Skilled work overview

On slide bullets  
• You usually need a job offer that meets national rules  
• Salary floors matter  
• Employer compliance matters  
• Family planning is often easier than under study

Speaker notes  
• Explain the “work route” is not one permit, it is a bundle of permits  
• Explain that some permits are national, and some are EU scheme permits such as EU Blue Card  
• Stress that the employer often files key steps, especially in the Netherlands

Legal and technical facts  
• Sweden requires salary and conditions in line with collective agreements or common practice, and a minimum salary floor for a work permit. citeturn14search0turn14search2  
• Netherlands highly skilled migrant route requires an employer recognised by the IND to apply. citeturn10search6
